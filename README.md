# Portfolio Website - V2
The second of my portfolio websites - a 'version 2' which includes better code, and a sleeker and more original design. Another good project to practice my pure HTML/CSS/JS as well as to show off all the other work I've done. 

Leaving it open-sourced so that employers can have a gander and others can take inspiration for their own portfolio websites :)
